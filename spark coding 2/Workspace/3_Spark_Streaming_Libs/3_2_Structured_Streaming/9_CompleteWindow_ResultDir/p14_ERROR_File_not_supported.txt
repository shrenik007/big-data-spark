The StreamingDataFrame is considered as an unbound table, which keeps growing on each time step. 
In Complete mode, the entire updated result table will be written to the external storage.

In this example the new rows arriving on each time step are enriched with the current timestamp. 
We create windows of slide_dur = 1 and window_dur = 2

The results are aggregated by (word, timestamp-based window) and sorted by (ascending time-window, descending num_words).

As we can see, both Spark Streaming and Structured Streaming show the results for the "closed" (fully completed) windows. 
However, Structured Streaming also shows preliminary results for "already opened but still not closed" (partially completed) windows. 

The files are being transferred over time.
