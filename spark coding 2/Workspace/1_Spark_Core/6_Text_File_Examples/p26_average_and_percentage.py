# PYTHON PROGRAM DEFINITION
#
# The knowledge a computer has of Python can be specified in 3 levels:
# (1) Prelude knowledge --> The computer has it by default.
# (2) Borrowed knowledge --> The computer gets this knowledge from 3rd party libraries defined by others
#                            (but imported by us in this program).
# (3) Generated knowledge --> The computer gets this knowledge from the new functions defined by us in this program.
#
# When launching in a terminal the command:
# user:~$ python3 this_file.py
# our computer first processes this PYTHON PROGRAM DEFINITION section of the file.
# On it, our computer enhances its Python knowledge from levels (2) and (3) with the imports and new functions
# defined in the program. However, it still does not execute anything.

    # Thus, map would have given us an RDD where each item had been a list of words, the list of words on each line (i.e., each item had been [String]).
    # On the other hand, flatMap allows us to flat the lists and get instead an RDD where each item is a String, a word of the dataset.

    # F1 must receive as input 1 parameter: The value of the (key, value) pair.
    # F1 must produce as an output 1 parameter: The accumulator accum generated for the pair (key, accum), created after
    # processing the first (key, value).

    # F2: To be applied in parallel to each node of the cluster.
    # The function is responsible of answering this question:
    # How do you want Spark to process all (key, value) pairs for each key k after having processed the first one and have got an accumulator ?

    # If a node contains 1000 entries (key, value) with key 'k', F2 will be applied 999 times, for all except the first (key, value) found.
    # F2 must receive as input 2 parameters:
    # - The accumulor generated until now.
    # - The value of the new (key, value) pair being found.
    # F2 must produce as an output 1 parameter: The updated accumulator, after aggregating it with the new (key, value) being found.

    # F3: To be applied as a whole single process through all nodes of the cluster.
    # The function is responsible of answering this question:
    # How do you want Spark to process all (key, accumulator) pairs so as to get a whole single (key, accumulator) pair ?

    # If combineByKey is applied to n nodes, F3 will be applied n-1 times, to merge all accumulators under a single accumulator.
    # F3 must receive as input 2 parameters:
    # - The meta-accumulor generated until now.
    # - The accumulator generated by node i, being processed now.
    # F3 must produce as an output 1 parameter: The updated accumulator, after aggregating it with the new (key, accumulator) being found.
